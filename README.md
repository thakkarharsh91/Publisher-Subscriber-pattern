# Publisher-Subscriber-pattern

The project is based on the publisher subscriber model where the subscriber first subscribes to the product that the subscriber wishes to buy for.
After this , the publisher will notify the subscriber once the product is available.

The program will take products as input in the form of csv file and will process the products and generate the output in the console.

This is for testing purpose.
